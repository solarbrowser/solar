## 🔭 Vision

Solar is a brand-new, fully open-source web browser developed entirely from scratch — **no Chromium, no Firefox**. Designed with **modularity**, **privacy**, and **performance** in mind, it aims to redefine how browsers adapt to their users.

Solar isn't just a browser. It’s a **framework** for building browsing experiences, tailored to user types like:

- 🧮 Developers & Power Users  
- 🕹 Gamers  
- 🎨 Content Creators  
- 🌱 Minimalists  

> ⚠️ Some features listed below may not be available in the latest commit yet. Development is active and evolving rapidly.

## 🚀 Features (WIP)

### Engine Layers
- **Custom Rendering Engine:** Based on `Cairo`, currently supports `block`, `inline`, and `flex` layouts.
- **JavaScript Engine:** `Quanta` – lightweight and extensible.
- **Optimisation Core:** `PhotonEngine` – performance tuning for low-end systems.
- **AI Customization:** Learns user habits for smart interface tweaks.

### Core Functions
- 🧭 Offline-first design with optional cloud sync  
- 🛡 Built-in anti-tracking and sandboxed tab environment  
- 🔌 Extension support (planned for v2.0)  
- 🌍 Full localization (multi-language syntax support in custom scripting)  
- 🧰 DevTools with custom protocol inspection

## 💡 Philosophy
